## Project analysis:
The recipient of our project is a professional looking for workers for his company. This user generally has better skills and experiences than us and has sufficient criteria to analyze our resume. Our expectation is that this user will find in our project an opportunity to include us in their work environment.
		
## Information architecture:
Since our project focuses on being a single web page, it is crucial to maintain a clear and understandable structure on the single page that users will explore. Critical information, such as work experience and skills, should be presented in an organized and logical manner for easy understanding.

## Visual design:
- Color Palette: A bright and elegant color palette has been chosen that incorporates light orange tones to convey confidence and professionalism. These are combined with different types of gray. These colors have been selected with the help of recommended online palettes to guarantee the readability of the text and highlighting different elements.
- Typography: I use a "sansation" typeface for the entire website as it offers a clean, contemporary look on digital devices. For titles and highlights, I increase the size to capture the user's attention and guide their reading.
- Page Layout: Inspired by similar projects I use clearly defined sections to present work experience, key skills and projects.
